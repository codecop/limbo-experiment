# tcr-in-practice

Try the TCR workflow on a larger code kata: [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game))

## Setup

```console
$ pip install --editable .
```

## TCR

```console
$ ./tcr_loop
```

For debugging purposes, consider running the bits and pieces 
in `tcr` in isolation.


## Play the Game

```console
$ python main.py
```
